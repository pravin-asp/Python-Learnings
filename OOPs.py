# OOPs --> Object Oriented Programming Language

# Procedure Oriented Programming Language
# Functional Oriented Programming Langugae
# Modular Programming

# Paradigm - Karuthu

# Object Oriented Programming Language is paradigm (idea)

# In python everything is 
# Python is a multi paradigm programming language

# Object	- Real time entity
#		 	- Combination of states and behaviour
#			- Object can't be present without class
#			- Object is memory reference of a class

# Class - is a  template or is blueprint

# Inheritance - generation qualities

# HumanBeing - Template -> Class 

# Object - states and behaviour

# Code Reusability -- again and again using the same code
# which means not using the code done by the some persong

# Encapsulation Polymorphism Inheritance supports code reusability

# Encapsulation  -- like giving protection to some things and giving permission like whatsapp status(who can see the status --> one type of Encapsulation)
# - human being - personal - atm, lock, diary - personal
# - personal - saying friends --> like module
# - relatives --> marks
# - public --> going to school, college

# Encapsulation -- simply data protection
#				-- data binding

# Inheritance - like generation to generation
#	- Object of one class behaving as an object of another class

# Abstraction --> data hiding
# Car : class --> steering, gear, accelertor, clutch, break --> how it works is hided
#				  use is not hidden
#				  Showing only the necessary data and hiding the unwanted one.

# Polymorphism
# Poly - many - рокро▓
# Showing different faces at different places
